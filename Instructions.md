# Research a new technology

In the field of technology, you will be continuously learning. This assignment is geared towards both the process and execution for learning about a new technology. 

## Getting Started

Start by deciding which programming language, framework or technology that you would like to learn. Some ideas and directions include:

- Other languages to explore might include TypeScript, PHP, Ruby, Java, C#, or Go
- Front-end frameworks might include Angular or Vue
- Mobile application development with Swift, Android, or React Native
- Other types of databases, for example NoSQL database like MongoDB
- ORM (object relational mapping) tools such as Sequelize
- Cloud services such as AWS or Azure
- If styling is your thing, you might look at SASS or other CSS frameworks or utilities

There are many other options too. These are just some ideas to show the potential. 

Once you've made a decision, find the main source for documentation of your selected technology. Look up 101 tutorials (books, videos, blogs, examples) and determine what software you'll need to get started. Spend some time to determine what your selected technology is good at. 

- What is it replacing in your technology stack?
- If it's an addition to your technology stack, do you understand conceptually how it upgrades your Stack?
- Tips:
  - Lynda.com and Pluralsight.com usually offer the first 1 or 2 videos of any given topic for free. Watch those videos.
  - Look for Tutorials that center around the concept of ‘Up and running with…’. 
  - Understand that this approach may not be correctly aligned with your context, either being too basic or too advanced. Be comfortable with the idea of interfacing with either.


> Keep in mind that some technologies like Swift and Android require large software installations to get started. Others are just very broad and will require you focus in on something specific to get started with. 

## Getting Started & Hello World

Start by getting tools installed (if needed). As you do this, make sure you're updating your readme files with notes or resources for getting started. Then build a small 'hello world' type example and commit it to GitHub. 

> Make sure that you're not spending too much time lost in tutorials here! Try to keep things actionable & leave time for creating an action plan (described below).

## Action Plan/Next Steps

This step is very important. It can be easy to get lost in a new technology without having specific tasks to focus on. At Prime, we created those tasks for you. Your next step is to create a list of small projects or exercises you could work on to further your knowledge on the selected technology. Focus on things that your selected technology is normally used for. Estimate how long you expect each of these projects or exercises to take. You can use this plan to continue learning & researching this technology later on.

After finishing this, you may continue working on your initial code example. 

## What to submit

You should submit a link to a GitHub repository with your code & a ReadMe file summarizing your initial research work, noting resources that you found useful, AND your action plan to continue this research/work later.
