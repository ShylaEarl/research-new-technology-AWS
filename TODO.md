## Notes from Reese
You'll have to create an account with AWS to get your key and whatnot. Also, the big issue I had was dealing with the CORS policy - basically the same kind of issue that everyone had to sort out with the Python/JavaScript connection. I couldn't quite get mine to work and I'm not sure why so if you have success with it let me know!
